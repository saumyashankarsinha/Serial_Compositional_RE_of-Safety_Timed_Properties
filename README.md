# Serial Compositional Runtime Enforcement of Safety Timed Properties
This repository contains additional material for the work titled "Serial Compositional Runtime Enforcement of Safety Timed Properties".  
Specifically, it contains 
- proofs of the propositions included in the paper (Section 1 of document.pdf),
- an example to show the evolution of the enforcement function from the framework that we consider in this work (Section 2 of document.pdf), and
- properties (along with their automata) from a non-critical system: e-commerce company, to demonstrate how these systems can profit from Runtime Enforcement (Section 3 of document.pdf).
